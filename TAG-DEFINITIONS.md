### Description
- There are 3 major **groupings** of tags. [People Tags](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/new/develop#people-tags), [Scene Tags](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/new/develop#scene-tags), and [Action Tags](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/new/develop#action-tags).  
These three groupings are further divided into multiple **categories**.  
All tags belong to a category and all categories belong to a grouping.  
- Notes and definitions on individual **tags**, **groupings**, and **categories** can be found at the links below.
- Some tags will be somewhat subjective by their very nature, particularly in categories that attempt to describe ranges in size or color. For these instances, a tag will be considered appropriate based on the following questions:  
"Could a reasonable person consider this tag as fitting?"  
"Would a reasonable person be overly surprised to see this as a result when searching for that tag?"  
- The terms **performer** and **character** are used often in tag descriptions.  
**Performer** refers to the actors and actresses themselves, regardless of what role they play within a scene.  
**Character** refers to the role a performer plays within a scene, even if their role is relatively undefined or if they are simply playing themselves.
> Block quotes like this denote aliases. Currently, all aliases are derived from tags listed at https://stashdb.org/tags. If no aliases were found there, a tag will be marked with [NONE]. If no block quote exists, then a search has yet to be done.

# PEOPLE TAGS  
*Describes various aspects of performers including body, hair, and clothes. Some tags will be the same for a performer across all scenes. Others will vary between scenes. If a performer is found to fall in a middle ground between two tags, both tags may be used.*

## Age Group  
*Describes the general age range of a **character**. Because exact ages can be determined from listed birthdates, this category is instead used more to describe how a performer is presented in a particular scene. Note that this is the only category under **People Tags** that describes a **character** and not a **performer**.*

#### Teen
Performer's character is presented as either high school age or college age. Does not need to be specifically labelled a teen in video or official description. General age range (of character not performer) 18-22.
> 18, 18 Year Old, 18 Years Old, 18+, 18+ Teen, 18+ Teens, 18+Teen, 18+Teens, 18-23, 18-24, 18-Year-Old, 19 Years Old, 19-Year-Old, Naughty American Teen Sex

#### MILF
Performer's character is presented as older and mature, often fitting the "MILF" stereotypes of teachers, mothers, and business executives with big "enhanced" breasts. General age range (of character not performer) 40+.
> 40s, Milf, Milf Pornstar, Milf Sugarbabes, Milfs, Milfu


## Race
*Describes the general racial background of a performer. Because many performers have mixed racial backgrounds, multiple **Race** tags may be used for a single performer. The tag [Mixed Race](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/new/develop#mixed-race) should also be included in these instances.*

#### White
Describes performers with broadly European racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as "Pale", "Medium Skin", or "Tan".
> Caucasian, White, White Girl, White Girls, White Skin, Whiteskin

#### Black
Describes performers with broadly African racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as "Light Brown" or "Dark Skin".
> Black Girl, Black Girls, Black Women

#### Latina
Describes performers with broadly Central and South American racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as "Tan" or "Light Brown".

#### South Asian
Describes performers with broadly South Asian racial backgrounds (particularly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.), often with skin tones tagged as "Light Brown".

#### Indigenous
Describes performers with broadly indigenous racial backgrounds from a largely colonized country, often with skin tones tagged as "Tan" or "Light Brown". Indigenous peoples are often also referred to as first peoples, first nations, aboriginal peoples or native peoples.

#### Jewish
Describes performers with broadly Jewish racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as "Medium Skin" or "Tan".

#### Mixed Race
Describes performers tagged with more than one racial background. Could be tagged with any range of skin tones.


## Hair Color

#### Blonde
Describes performers with light, yellowish hair colors.
> Blond, Blond Hair, Blonde, Blonde Hair, Blonde Teen, Blondes, Dirty Blonde

#### Brunette
Describes performers with brownish hair colors.
> Brown Hair, Brunett, Brunette, Brunettes, Brunnette

> Black Hair, Raven Hair, Raven Haired

#### Redhead
Describes performers with reddish/orangeish hair colors. If the color is a particularly unnatural shade of red, often used in conjunction with "Unnatural Color". 
> Ginger, Red, Red Hair, Red Head, Redhair, Redhead, Redheads


## Breasts
*Describes the proportional size of a performer's breasts as well as whether they are natural or not. Because exact bra sizes may be listed for each individual performer, this category is instead used to describe the **proportional** size of a performer's breasts compared to the rest of their body. This way, it accounts for how the same cup size could look notably different when describing tall performers versus short performers. If a performer is found to fall in a middle ground between two tags, both tags may be used.*

#### Tiny Breasts
Describes breasts that are exceptionally small to the point of having very little shape to them. Typically around the A cup sizes.
> Tiny Tits

#### Small Breasts
Describes breasts that are proportionally small compared to the size of the performer. Typically around the A-B cup sizes.

Describes breasts that have been surgically augmented/enhanced through the use of implants.
> Big Boobs (Implants), Big Fake Tits, Fake Boobs, Fake Tits, Medium Fake Tits


## Ass
*Describes the proportional size of a performer's butt, in comparison to the size of their body. If a performer is found to fall in a middle ground between two tags, both tags may be used.*

> Smal Butt, Small Ass, Small Booty, Small Butt, Small-Ass

> [NONE]


## Height
*Decribes the height range of a performer. Because absolute height measurements may be listed within a performer's profile page, this category is instead used to group together similar heights. These tags intentionally overlap a little. Performers whose height fall under multiple ranges should have multiple tags included. All heights are currently described by imperial measurements. Some adjustments on these ranges may be made after further discussion including the addition of measurements in metric.*

#### Tiny
Decribes very short performers< covering heights of 5'0" and lower.

#### Petite
Decribes relatively short performers, covering heights from 5'0" up to 5'4".

#### Tall

## Pussy
*Describes a performer's pubic hair. Currently only includes tags for length, but additional tags for color may be added. If a performer is found to fall in a middle ground between two tags, both tags may be used.*

#### Smooth
Describes a performer without any pubic hair.
> Bald, Bald Pussy, Shaved, Shaved Bush, Shaved Pubic Hair, Shaved Pussy, Shaved Pussy Hair, Shaven, Smooth, Smooth Pussy, Waxed Pussy

#### Trimmed
Describes pubic hair that is neatly trimmed and shaped.

## Tattoos
*Describes in broad terms how many tattoos a performer has. The tag [Lots of Tattoos](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/new/develop#lots-of-tattoos) is meant to be used as an addition to [Has Tattoos](has-tattoos) when appropriate.*

## Piercings

#### Piercings
