### Description
- There are 3 major **groupings** of tags. [People Tags](#people-tags), [Scene Tags](#scene-tags), and [Action Tags](#action-tags).  
These three groupings are further divided into multiple **categories**.  
All tags belong to a category and all categories belong to a grouping.  
- Notes and definitions on individual **tags**, **groupings**, and **categories** can be found at the links below.
- Some tags will be somewhat subjective by their very nature, particularly in categories that attempt to describe ranges in size or color. For these instances, a tag will be considered appropriate based on the following questions:  
"Could a reasonable person consider this tag as fitting?"  
"Would a reasonable person be overly surprised to see this as a result when searching for that tag?"  
- The terms **performer** and **character** are used often in tag descriptions.  
**Performer** refers to the actors and actresses themselves, regardless of what role they play within a scene.  
**Character** refers to the role a performer plays within a scene, even if their role is relatively undefined or if they are simply playing themselves.
> Block quotes like this denote aliases. Currently, all aliases are derived from tags listed at https://stashdb.org/tags. If no aliases were found there, a tag will be marked with [NONE]. If no block quote exists, then a search has yet to be done.

# PEOPLE TAGS  
*Describes various aspects of performers including body, hair, and clothes. Some tags will be the same for a performer across all scenes. Others will vary between scenes. If a performer is found to fall in a middle ground between two tags, both tags may be used.*

## Age Group  
*Describes the general age range of a **character**. Because exact ages can be determined from listed birthdates, this category is instead used more to describe how a performer is presented in a particular scene. Note that this is the only category under **People Tags** that describes a **character** and not a **performer**.*

#### Teen
Performer's character is presented as either high school age or college age. Does not need to be specifically labelled a teen in video or official description. General age range (of character not performer) 18-22.
> 18, 18 Year Old, 18 Years Old, 18+, 18+ Teen, 18+ Teens, 18+Teen, 18+Teens, 18-23, 18-24, 18-Year-Old, 19 Years Old, 19-Year-Old, Naughty American Teen Sex

#### MILF
Performer's character is presented as older and mature, often fitting the "MILF" stereotypes of teachers, mothers, and business executives with big "enhanced" breasts. General age range (of character not performer) 40+.
> 40s, Milf, Milf Pornstar, Milf Sugarbabes, Milfs, Milfu


## Race
*Describes the general racial background of a performer. Because many performers have mixed racial backgrounds, multiple **Race** tags may be used for a single performer. The tag [Mixed Race](#mixed-race) should also be included in these instances.*

#### White
Describes performers with broadly European racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Pale](#pale), [Skin Tone: Medium Skin](#medium-skin), or [Skin Tone: Tan](#tan).
> Caucasian, White, White Girl, White Girls, White Skin, Whiteskin

#### Black
Describes performers with broadly African racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Light Brown](#light-brown) or [Skin Tone: Dark Skin](#dark-skin).
> Black Girl, Black Girls, Black Women

#### Latina
Describes performers with broadly Central and South American racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Tan](#tan) or [Skin Tone: Light Brown](#light-brown).
> Latin, Latina, Latina Pornstar

#### Asian

#### Middle Eastern
Describes performers with broadly North African or West Asian racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Tan](#tan) or [Skin Tone: Light Brown](#light-brown).

#### South Asian
Describes performers with broadly South Asian racial backgrounds (particularly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.), often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Light Brown](#light-brown).

#### Indigenous
Describes performers with broadly indigenous racial backgrounds from a largely colonized country, often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Tan](#tan) or [Skin Tone: Light Brown](#light-brown). Indigenous peoples are often also referred to as first peoples, first nations, aboriginal peoples or native peoples.

#### Jewish
Describes performers with broadly Jewish racial backgrounds, often with skin tones tagged as [Skin Tone: Medium Skin](#medium-skin) or [Skin Tone: Tan](#tan).

#### Mixed Race
Describes performers tagged with more than one racial background. Could be tagged with any range of skin tones.


## Hair Color
*Describes the color of a performer's hair. Multiple **Hair Color** tags may be used for a single performer to describe hair that could reasonably fit multiple tag definitions.*

#### Blonde
Describes performers with light, yellowish hair colors.
> Blond, Blond Hair, Blonde, Blonde Hair, Blonde Teen, Blondes, Dirty Blonde

#### Brunette
Describes performers with brownish hair colors.
> Brown Hair, Brunett, Brunette, Brunettes, Brunnette

#### Raven
Describes performers with extremely dark hair colors. Used alone for pure black hair colors. Used in combination with [Hair Color: Dark Brunette](#dark-brunette) for dark browns that read as black on camera, most often for non-white performers.

#### Redhead
Describes performers with reddish/orangeish hair colors. If the color is a particularly unnatural shade of red, often used in conjunction with [Hair Color: Unnatural Color](#unnatural-color). 
> Ginger, Red, Red Hair, Red Head, Redhair, Redhead, Redheads


## Breasts
*Describes the proportional size of a performer's breasts as well as whether they are natural or not. Because exact bra sizes may be listed for each individual performer, this category is instead used to describe the **proportional** size of a performer's breasts compared to the rest of their body. This way, it accounts for how the same cup size could look notably different when describing tall performers versus short performers. If a performer is found to fall in a middle ground between two tags, both tags may be used.*

#### Tiny Breasts
Describes breasts that are exceptionally small to the point of having very little shape to them. Typically around the A cup sizes.
> Tiny Tits

#### Small Breasts

#### Huge Ass

> [NONE]


## Height
*Decribes the height range of a performer. Because absolute height measurements may be listed within a performer's profile page, this category is instead used to group together similar heights. These tags intentionally overlap a little. Performers whose height fall under multiple ranges should have multiple tags included. All heights are currently described by imperial measurements. Some adjustments on these ranges may be made after further discussion including the addition of measurements in metric.*

## Relations
*Describes the relationship between characters in a scene. Currently, most of these tags are framed as who the female character is in relation to a male character. This system will need to be expanded to better cover same-sex and trans relationships.*

#### Gonzo (Relation)
Describes scenes in which the performers are not playing any characters at all, not even vague impressions of characters (see [Relations: Unknown Relation](#unknown-relation) instead). Since the performers are simply playing themselves, the only relationship to describe is that of adult actors working together. Often used along with [Themes: Gonzo](#gonzo-theme) and [Motivations: Gonzo](#gonzo-motivation).

#### Paid Amateur
Describes scenes in which the female character is supposedly a stranger plucked off the street by a porn production crew, filming with the promise of being paid. Often used along with [Motivations: Paid](#paid) and [Themes: Reality](#reality). If the female performer is *not* at least a semi-professional adult actress who was obviously hired beforehand for the shoot, then it can be used along with [Themes: Amateur](#amateur) and [Themes: Gonzo](#gonzo-theme).

#### Professional
Describes female characters who may be hired for sexual services. Note that this tag describes characters and not the performers themselves, though depending on context they may be one and the same. See Themes: [Themes: Gonzo](#gonzo-theme) and [Themes: Reality](#reality) for contexts where this line is blurred. Often used along with [Motivations: Paid](#paid).

#### Stripper
Describes female characters who may be paid to dance naked. Note that this tag describes characters and not the performers themselves, though depending on context they may be one and the same. See [Themes: Gonzo](#gonzo-theme) and [Themes: Reality](#reality) for contexts where this line is blurred. Often used along with [Motivations: Paid](#paid).

#### Stranger
Describes characters who have no prior relationhip whatsoever. Often, the characters know very little about each other. The tags [Themes: Just Met](#just-met) and [Themes: Haven't Fucked](#haven-t-fucked) should always be included as well.

#### Unknown Relation
Describes characters within vague narratives where their exact relationship is left unclear. Rather than listing all of the relationships that could possibly fit, this tag is used instead.

#### Friend
Describes characters who are friends and whose relationship is non-romantic and non-sexual, at least on the surface. If more specific [Category: Relations](#relations) tags are a better fit, they should be used instead.

#### Casual Affair
Describes characters who are involved in an ongoing sexual relationship without a significant commitment to each other. These characters may or may not be in a committed relationships to somebody else. If they are, see [Roles: Cheater](#cheater) and [Roles: Mistress](#mistress).
